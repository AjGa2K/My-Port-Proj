    <p>Hi! My name's Angel, I'm a college graduate on Computer science who is looking to become a Full Stack Web Engineer.
        For the moment I'm learning the front end but pretty soon I'll be uploading back end with java and maybe even more languages and hopefully land a job where I can put my experiences/knowledge to the test.
        I graduated in my class with a Cum Laude 3.48 GPA and I'm constantly trying to improve by any means, I'm even taking online courses on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/AJG_2K">CodeCademy</a> where they have plenty of online resources and courses in all diverse career paths 
        that Computer Science has to offer. Thank you for taking the time to check out my web page, and hopefully I'll have more for you to see pretty soon! 
    </p>
