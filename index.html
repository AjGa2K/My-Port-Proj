            <img src="imgs/cc.jpg" alt="CCTS">
                <p>For my final semester in my Bachelors degree I was accepted for an internship in a Company called CC Technology Solutions.
                    While I was there, I was tasked into editing a company project front and back end to help the page look more presentable and run more efficient. 
                        I completed 7 out of 8 tasks assigned to me due to my internship coming to an end.</p>

        <p>I also was tasked with learning a new language called Angular, 
            which is an extension to Java and helps pages run and be more efficient.</p>

                <p>In my university I was part of the Work&Study Program, I worked at the registration office where students would need help registering for next semesters,
                    dropping or adding classes, working with sensitive information such as: SSN, Emails, Passwords, Student files and records, etc. 
                        I also took calls of staff/employees and students aswell provinding customer service and tech support to them. </p>

                    <p>Right now I'm currently working on improving my own skills so that I can start my own freelancing business and essentially grow into a company where I can provide good and efficient websites for anyone interested.
